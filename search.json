    "text": "The Structure of a for Loop\nBefore jumping into various techniques, a brief refresher on the basic structure of for loops may be helpful. At its core a for loop really has two elements: a loop variable and an iterable object. In the below example, item is the loop variable, and items is the iterable object.\nitems = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nfor item in items:\n    print(item)\nI think the loop variable can be confusing for beginners because it seems to come out of nowhere. What is item? Where was it defined? Is it important that the word item was used? The answer is that this is a special type of variable that Python uses to move through the iterable. In fact, item is simply a placeholder and could be anything: num, idx, and even just a basic _.\nThe second important component of the for loop is the iterable object. Iterable objects in Python include lists, sets, dictionaries, strings, and other special objects, for example range(). More on that below."

    "title": "A Beginner and Intermediate Python User’s Guide to Iterating with for Loops",
    "section": "By Index",
    "text": "By Index\nThe next most common way of looping through an iterable is by index. This assumes of course that the iterable has indexes. That means lists, tuples, strings and range objects. When we want to loop through the indexes of an iterable with indexes, most of the time we actually need to loop through an appropriate sequence of numbers as opposed the iterable itself. And to do that we are going to use a range object.\n\nWhat is a range object?\nA range object is a special immutable sequence in Python that represents a progression of integers. A range object can take three arguments: start, stop, step. start is the number at which the range object should start counting from. stop is where it should stop generating numbers. And step indicates the amount of numbers that should be skipped to get to the next number (e.g. if you wanted to count by twos or threes).\nPython will interpret a single number provided to a range object as the stop argument.\nCrucial for our discussion of loops is that the stop argument is interpreted to be non-inclusive, and that the default start argument will be 0.\nSome examples:\nrange(10) #0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\n\nrange(0,10,2) #2, 4, 6, 8\n\nIterating with range\nrange()’s step function means that we can easily iterate through every other element of an iterable.\nfor num in range(0, 11, 2):\n    print(num)\n\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n\n\n\nUsing len in combination with range\nA common tactic when you want to loop through indexes is to use range in combination with len. The output of len is the number of characters or elements in an iterable.\nlen('start') #5\nlen([1,2,3]) #3\nlen starts counting at 1, which is useful for us in the context of using range to in a for loop. Imagine, for example, that we wanted to print every letter of this alphabet string: 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.' The easiest way to do this of course would be to use the item-by-item approach above. But let’s just say you wanted to make things difficult and print the letters according to their index number.\nThat means we need to iterate through all 26 letters. More specifically, we need to iterate through the numbers 0 to 25, because indexing starts at 0.Using range and len in conjunction is a perfect solution to this. len(abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz) is going to give us 26. And recall that the stop argument of range is non-inclusive, so range(26) is going to give us exactly the sequence of numbers we need to accomplish our task. Even better, we can simply pass len(abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz) as the stop argument to the range object:\nalphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'\n\nfor num in range(len(alphabet)):\n    print(num) #0, 1, 2, ... 25\nNotice here that what prints is nothing from alphabet. All alphabet gives us is the number 26. The following would be equivalent to the above:\nalphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'\n\nfor num in range(26):\n    print(num) #0, 1, 2, ... 25\nGoing back to our task—accessing and printing each letter of the alphabet via index, now what is left to do is the accessing part. To do that, we use the same syntax we normally use for accessing an element via index: iterable[index].\nLet’s go back to the loop. First, let’s take a look at the loop variable. While any variable name here would suffice, it can be helpful (for yourself and others) to use something more descriptive. Since our aim is to loop through the index numbers, we can use a word like idx or index as our variable name:\nalphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'\n\nfor index in range(len(alphabet)):\n    print(alphabet[index]) #a, b, c, ... z\nVoilà! We’ve done it. As the loop variable index increases alphabet[index] allows us to access each element of our alphabet string."

Here we’re using a window of size 2 (i + 1) to look at pairs of adjacent elements."

    "section": "By Index and Element Using enumerate()",
    "text": "By Index and Element Using enumerate()\nWe’ve seen how to loop item-by-item and through the index, but sometimes we want to do both. Rather than create two separate loops, Python has a great function, enumerate(), that allows us to iterate through both the items and the indexes simultaneously.\nenumerate takes as arguments an iterable and an optional start value, which has a default value of 0 (i.e. starting from the first element in the iterable). When we use enumerate in a for loop, we use two loop variables: one for the index, and one for the item in the index position. Since the return value of enumerate is a tuple with the index value first, it’s important that our loop variables are specified in that order or else we’ll get confused! It looks like this:\nmeals = ['pizza', 'pasta', 'salad']\n\nfor index, meal in enumerate(meals):\n    print(index, meal)\n\n#0 pizza\n#1 pasta\n#2 salad\nenumerate is a great tool to have in your Python toolkit, especially when you encounter tricky problems that involve both indices and the items. Take the following problem as an example.\n\nExamples Using enumerate()\nYou are given a list of daily max temperatures.\ndecember_temps = [\n    32, 28, 35, 40, 38, 33, 29, 25, 22, 30,  # Dec 1-10\n    34, 38, 42, 45, 43, 39, 36, 32, 28, 31,  # Dec 11-20\n    35, 38, 34, 30, 27, 24, 20, 18, 22, 26,  # Dec 21-30\n    30                                        # Dec 31\n]\nYou task is to return the days of the month that had temperatures less than 30 degrees. Without enumerate we would probably need to loop through the list, check to see if the temp was less than 30, and then return the relevant index positions (+1 because they start at 0). With enumerate() the solution is much simpler:\ndays_below_30 = []\nfor day, temp in enumerate(december_temps, start=1):\n    if temp &lt; 30:\n        days_below_30.append(day)\nWe could also write the same answer as a list comprehension:\ndays_below_30 = [day for day, temp in enumerate(december_temps, start=1) if temp &lt; 30]\nAnother common use case of enumerate() is with strings. Often there are these problems that ask you to do something with every other letter. That is a great time to use enumerate() because for this type of problem we need to know the indexes (the ‘every other’ part of the problem) and we need to do something with the character. Imagine a problem that asks you, for example, to capitalize every other letter of a string. With enumerate() your solution could look something like this:\nstring = \"how does this string read in your head?\"\nnew_string = ''\n\nfor index, character in enumerate(string):\n    if index % 2 == 0:\n        new_string += character.upper()\n    else:\n        new_string += character\n\nprint(new_string) # HoW DoEs tHiS StRiNg rEaD In yOuR HeAd?\nVery nifty."

    "text": "Using ‘Sliding Windows’ to Evaluate Multiple Elements in a Row\nAnother tricky form of iteration involves evaluating consecutive elements simultaneously. This is probably best explained via an example. Imagine a problem that asks you to return the highest sum of three consecutive elements in a list. Given this list:\nlst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nWe need to iterate through this list three elements at a time to compare the following:\nsum([1,2,3])\nsum([2,3,4])\nsum([3,4,5])\nThere are a couple of different techniques for how to do this.\n\nCreating a ‘window’ with Slicing\nOne good technique for this type of problem is to use slicing.\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nmax_sum = 0\n\nfor i in range(len(numbers) - 2):\n    current_sum = sum(numbers[i:i+3])  # Slice of 3 elements\n    if current_sum &gt; max_sum:\n        max_sum = current_sum\nIn this loop the way we create the ‘window’ is numbers[i:i+3]. On the first loop through, for example, this will yield numbers[0:3]. Each time we go through the loop, as i increases by 1, the window moves through the list.\nFor this type of looping it is crucial to remember that we need to update the range object to reflect the fact that we are moving a ‘window’ through the iterable. The i+3 means that our slice is going to ‘hit’ the end of the range object before i.\nIt’s worth going in-depth on this because I think it can be confusing. Going back to our example, our list numbers has 5 index slots. [i:i+3] is going to have the following values:\nLoop 1: [0:3]\nLoop 2: [1:4]\nLoop 3: [2:5]\nLoop 4: [3:6] # There is no 6th index position!\nAs you can see, even though there are 5 index position, when we use a window we won’t actually loop through every index position because the ‘right side’ of our ‘window’ will hit the end of the range on at the end of the third loop—at least that’s how I like to think about it. That is why we need to reduce the size of the range object to compensate. The formula for reducing the range object is the length of the iterable (5 in this case) less the size of the window (3 in this case), which means we need to reduce the range object, in this case, by 2. range(len(number)) == range(5), so we want range(5 - 2) so that we iterate through the 0, 1, 2 index positions."

    "text": "Common for Loop Pitfalls\nHere are some of the most common pitfalls when it comes to deploying for loops.\n\nOff-by-One Errors with range()\nAs illustrated above, range() is a very powerful and flexible component of many for loops. It can also be very confusing to figure out especially when the stop value in range is abstracted (i.e. is given by passing in the result of a len() function call).\nAt the most basic level, the key is to remember that because the stop value of range() is exclusive, and indexing starts at 0, then the stop value provided to range() needs to be one greater than the length of your iterable.\nSay you want to print numbers 1 through 10. Your brain might instinctively think to use range(10), when actually what you need is range(11).\n# Stops at 9\nfor i in range(1, 10):\n    print(i)\n# Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\n\n# Stops at 10\nfor i in range(1, 11):\n    print(i)\n# Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\nThis gets especially tricky with the sliding window techniques, wherein we actually need to reduce the stop value provided to range() to compensate for the window we create in the iteration.\nYou can see in the below example what happens if we forget to reduce the range. We actually don’t get an error, since slicing is forgiving, but we do get values that we don’t necessarily want. In this case, even though we want a sum of multiple numbers, the slicing just keeps going. This would be a confusing result since there is no explicit error.\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n# Want to sum every 3 consecutive numbers\nfor i in range(len(numbers)):  # len(numbers) -&gt; 5\n    print(sum(numbers[i:i+3]))\n\n# 6 = (1 + 2 + 3)\n# 9 = (2 + 3 + 4)\n# 12 = (3 + 4 + 5)\n# 9 = (4 + 5)\n# 5 = 5\nPutting this example together made me realize how forgiving slicing is. Take a look at the following example and see if you can guess what it will print.\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nprint(numbers[4])\nprint(numbers[10:20])\nprint(numbers[10])\nHad you asked me this before writing this guide, I would have thought the second and third print lines would both throw an IndexError. But actually here is the result.\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nprint(numbers[4]) #5\nprint(numbers[10:20]) #[]\nprint(numbers[10]) #IndexError\nAnyway, the solution to this problem is to reduce the stop value provided to range() so that the looping stops once we’ve retrieved all the sums that we care about.\n# CORRECT:\nfor i in range(len(numbers) - 2):  # Stop 2 positions early\n    print(sum(numbers[i:i+3]))\n\n# 6 = (1 + 2 + 3)\n# 9 = (2 + 3 + 4)\n# 12 = (3 + 4 + 5)"
