## What is this?
This is my guide to iterating through `for` loops. `for` loops—based on my albeit limited experience—are probably the most common type of looping mechanism used in Python. So it behooves us to understand them well. This guide is an attempt to succinctly capture the main ways in which this type of loop can be used.

## The Structure of a `for` Loop
Before jumping into various techniques, a brief refresher on the basic structure of `for` loops may be helpful. At its core a `for` loop really has two elements: a loop variable and an iterable object. In the below example, `item` is the loop variable, and `items` is the iterable object.

``` python
items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for item in items:
    print(item)
```

I think the loop variable can be confusing for beginners because it seems to come out of nowhere. What is `item`? Where was it defined? Is it important that the word `item` was used? The answer is that this is a special type of variable that Python uses to move through the iterable. In fact, `item` is simply a placeholder and could be anything: `num`, `idx`, and even just a basic `_`.

The second important component of the `for` loop is the iterable object. Iterable objects in Python include `lists`, `sets`, `dictionaries`, `strings`, and other special objects, for example `range()`. More on that below.

## Item-by-Item
The most basic way that we can iterate with a `for` loop is to simply move through an iterable item-by-item. In the example above, for instance, we loop through each element of the list and print it. Each time the loop runs `item` is replaced by the next element of the list. Pretty simple!

## By Index
The next most common way of looping through an iterable is by index. This assumes of course that the iterable has indexes. That means `lists`, `tuples`, `strings` and `range` objects. When we want to loop through the indexes of an iterable with indexes, most of the time we actually need to loop through an appropriate sequence of numbers as opposed the iterable itself. And to do that we are going to use a `range` object.

### What is a `range` object?
A `range` object is a special immutable sequence in Python that represents a progression of integers. A `range` object can take three arguments: `start`, `stop`, `step`. `start` is the number at which the `range` object should start counting from. `stop` is where it should stop generating numbers. And `step` indicates the amount of numbers that should be skipped to get to the next number (e.g. if you wanted to count by twos or threes).

Python will interpret a single number provided to a `range` object as the `stop` argument.

Crucial for our discussion of loops is that the `stop` argument is interpreted to be non-inclusive, and that the default `start` argument will be `0`.

Some examples:

``` python
range(10) #0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

range(0,10,2) #2, 4, 6, 8
```

#### Iterating with `range`
`range()`'s step function means that we can easily iterate through every other element of an iterable.

``` python
for num in range(0, 11, 2):
    print(num)

0
2
4
6
8
10
```

### Using `len` in combination with `range`
A common tactic when you want to loop through indexes is to use `range` in combination with `len`. The output of `len` is the number of characters or elements in an iterable. 

```python
len('start') #5
len([1,2,3]) #3
```

`len` starts counting at `1`, which is useful for us in the context of using `range` to in a for loop. Imagine, for example, that we wanted to `print` every letter of this alphabet `string`: `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.'` The easiest way to do this of course would be to use the item-by-item approach above. But let's just say you wanted to make things difficult and print the letters according to their index number. 

That means we need to iterate through all 26 letters. More specifically, we need to iterate through the numbers 0 to 25, because indexing starts at 0.Using `range` and `len` in conjunction is a perfect solution to this. `len(abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz)` is going to give us `26`. And recall that the `stop` argument of `range` is non-inclusive, so `range(26)` is going to give us exactly the sequence of numbers we need to accomplish our task. Even better, we can simply pass `len(abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz)` as the stop argument to the range object:

```python
alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'

for num in range(len(alphabet)):
    print(num) #0, 1, 2, ... 25

```

Notice here that what prints is nothing from `alphabet`. All `alphabet` gives us is the number `26`. The following would be equivalent to the above:

```python
alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'

for num in range(26):
    print(num) #0, 1, 2, ... 25
```

Going back to our task—accessing and printing each letter of the alphabet via index, now what is left to do is the accessing part. To do that, we use the same syntax we normally use for accessing an element via index: `iterable[index]`.

Let's go back to the loop. First, let's take a look at the loop variable. While any variable name here would suffice, it can be helpful (for yourself and others) to use something more descriptive. Since our aim is to loop through the index numbers, we can use a word like `idx` or `index` as our variable name:

```python
alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'

for index in range(len(alphabet)):
    print(alphabet[index]) #a, b, c, ... z

```

Voilà! We've done it. As the loop variable `index` increases `alphabet[index]` allows us to access each element of our alphabet string. 

## Comparing Adjacent Elements
Using the above functions and techniques we can also compare adjacent iterable elements. For example, let's say you wanted to compare one element with the next element in the iterable to see if it was increasing or decreasing.

``` python
numbers = [5, 12, 8, 15, 3, 20]

# Compare each element with the next one
for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
    current = numbers[i] # Access current element
    next_item = numbers[i + 1] # Access next element
    
    if next_item > current:
        print(f"{current} → {next_item}: Increasing")
    else:
        print(f"{current} → {next_item}: Decreasing")
```
Notice here that you need to reduce the size of the `range` object because of [i + 1] which would result in an `IndexError` if you did not subtract 1 from the `range` object.

This is actually a simple form of the 'sliding window' technique we'll explore more later. Here we're using a window of size 2 (`i + 1`) to look at pairs of adjacent elements.

## By Index and Element Using `enumerate()`
We've seen how to loop item-by-item and through the index, but sometimes we want to do both. Rather than create two separate loops, Python has a great function, `enumerate()`, that allows us to iterate through both the items and the indexes simultaneously. 

`enumerate` takes as arguments an `iterable` and an optional `start` value, which has a default value of `0` (i.e. starting from the first element in the iterable). When we use `enumerate` in a `for` loop, we use two loop variables: one for the index, and one for the item in the index position. Since the return value of `enumerate` is a tuple with the index value first, it's important that our loop variables are specified in that order or else we'll get confused! It looks like this:

```python
meals = ['pizza', 'pasta', 'salad']

for index, meal in enumerate(meals):
    print(index, meal)

#0 pizza
#1 pasta
#2 salad

```

`enumerate` is a great tool to have in your Python toolkit, especially when you encounter tricky problems that involve both indices and the items. Take the following problem as an example.

### Examples Using `enumerate()`
You are given a list of daily max temperatures.

``` python
december_temps = [
    32, 28, 35, 40, 38, 33, 29, 25, 22, 30,  # Dec 1-10
    34, 38, 42, 45, 43, 39, 36, 32, 28, 31,  # Dec 11-20
    35, 38, 34, 30, 27, 24, 20, 18, 22, 26,  # Dec 21-30
    30                                        # Dec 31
]
```
You task is to return the days of the month that had temperatures less than 30 degrees. Without enumerate we would probably need to loop through the list, check to see if the temp was less than 30, and then return the relevant index positions (+1 because they start at 0). With `enumerate()` the solution is much simpler:

``` python
days_below_30 = []
for day, temp in enumerate(december_temps, start=1):
    if temp < 30:
        days_below_30.append(day)
```

We could also write the same answer as a list comprehension:

``` python
days_below_30 = [day for day, temp in enumerate(december_temps, start=1) if temp < 30]
```

Another common use case of `enumerate()` is with strings. Often there are these problems that ask you to do something with every other letter. That is a great time to use `enumerate()` because for this type of problem we need to know the indexes (the 'every other' part of the problem) and we need to do something with the character. Imagine a problem that asks you, for example, to capitalize every other letter of a string. With `enumerate()` your solution could look something like this:

``` python
string = "how does this string read in your head?"
new_string = ''

for index, character in enumerate(string):
    if index % 2 == 0:
        new_string += character.upper()
    else:
        new_string += character

print(new_string) # HoW DoEs tHiS StRiNg rEaD In yOuR HeAd?

```

Very nifty.

## Breaking Out of `for` Loops
Sometimes we want the loop to stop looping when a certain condition has been met. You may, for example, want to stop looping once you've found the thing you're looking for. We can stop the loop using `break`.

``` python
# Stop searching when you've found the 'target'
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 101, 6, 7]

for num in numbers:
    if num > 100:
        print('Found a number greater than 100!')
        break
    print('Checking numbers...')
```

## Skipping Iterations Using `continue`
We can use `continue` to skip the rest of a loop and jump to the next iteration. This is useful if you know there are values you want to ignore in your list. 

### Printing Odd Numbers Using `continue`
```python
for num in range(20):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(num)

# 1
# 3
# 5
# 7
# 9
# 11
# 13
# 15
# 17
# 19
```

### Skipping Weekdays Using `continue`
``` python
WEEKEND = ['Sat', 'Sun']
days = ['Mon', 'Tues', 'Sat', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sun']

for day in days:
    if day in WEEKEND:
        continue
    print(f'{day} is a weekday!')

# Mon is a weekday!
# Tues is a weekday!
# Thu is a weekday!
# Fri is a weekday!
```

## Using 'Sliding Windows' to Evaluate Multiple Elements in a Row
Another tricky form of iteration involves evaluating consecutive elements simultaneously. This is probably best explained via an example. Imagine a problem that asks you to return the highest sum of three consecutive elements in a list. Given this list: 

``` python
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

We need to iterate through this list three elements at a time to compare the following:

``` python
sum([1,2,3])
sum([2,3,4])
sum([3,4,5])
```

There are a couple of different techniques for how to do this.

### Creating a 'window' with Slicing
One good technique for this type of problem is to use slicing. 

``` python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
max_sum = 0

for i in range(len(numbers) - 2):
    current_sum = sum(numbers[i:i+3])  # Slice of 3 elements
    if current_sum > max_sum:
        max_sum = current_sum
```

In this loop the way we create the 'window' is `numbers[i:i+3]`. On the first loop through, for example, this will yield `numbers[0:3]`. Each time we go through the loop, as `i` increases by `1`, the window moves through the list.

For this type of looping it is crucial to remember that we need to update the `range` object to reflect the fact that we are moving a 'window' through the iterable. The `i+3` means that our slice is going to 'hit' the end of the range object before `i`.

It's worth going in-depth on this because I think it can be confusing. Going back to our example, our list `numbers` has 5 index slots. `[i:i+3]` is going to have the following values:

``` python
Loop 1: [0:3]
Loop 2: [1:4]
Loop 3: [2:5]
Loop 4: [3:6] # There is no 6th index position!
```
As you can see, even though there are 5 index position, when we use a window we won't actually loop through every index position because the 'right side' of our 'window' will hit the end of the range on at the end of the third loop—at least that's how I like to think about it. That is why we need to reduce the size of the `range` object to compensate. The formula for reducing the `range` object is the length of the iterable (5 in this case) less the size of the window (3 in this case), which means we need to reduce the `range` object, in this case, by 2. `range(len(number))` == `range(5)`, so we want `range(5 - 2)` so that we iterate through the 0, 1, 2 index positions.

## Nested `for` Loops
More advanced problems often require loops within loops. A nested loop is a loop within another loop. When you have a nested loop, the inner loop completes all of its iterations for each iteration of the outer loop. A clock provides a useful analogy. A clock's hour hand is like an outer loop, and the minute hand is like an inner loop. For each movement of the hour hand (outer loop), the minute hand (inner loop) must complete a full set of iterations. Here's that analogy expressed as a loop:

``` python
for hour in range(0, 24): #24 hours in a day (0 is first hour, 23 last)
    for minute in range(0, 60): #60 minutes in an hour (but don't show 60)
        print(f'{hour}:{minute:02d}')
# 0:00
# 0:01
# 0:02
# 0:03
# 0:04
# 0:05
# 0:06
# 0:07
# 0:08
# 0:09
# 0:10
# 0:11
# 0:12
```

Nested loops are great for generating two-dimensional arrays or matrices—think a multiplication table or a deck of cards.

### Generating a Deck of Cards Using Nested Loops
```python
suits = ['♥', '♣', '♦', '♠']
values = ['A', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6',
              '7', '8', '9', '10',
              'J', 'Q', 'K'
              ]

deck = []

for suit in suits:
    for value in values:
        deck.append([suit, value])

print(deck)

#['♥', 'A'], ['♥', '2'], ['♥', '3'], ['♥', '4']...
```

### Generating a Multiplication Table Using Nested Loops
``` python
for x in range(11):
    for y in range(11):
        print(f'{x} x {y} = {x * y}')
    print('---')

# 0 x 0 = 0
# 0 x 1 = 0
# 0 x 2 = 0
# 0 x 3 = 0
# 0 x 4 = 0
# 0 x 5 = 0
# 0 x 6 = 0
# 0 x 7 = 0
# 0 x 8 = 0
# 0 x 9 = 0
# 0 x 10 = 0
# ---
# 1 x 0 = 0
# 1 x 1 = 1
# 1 x 2 = 2
# 1 x 3 = 3
# 1 x 4 = 4
# 1 x 5 = 5
# 1 x 6 = 6
# 1 x 7 = 7
# 1 x 8 = 8
# 1 x 9 = 9
# 1 x 10 = 10

```
## Double Loops and 'Variable-Size Windows'
A cousin of the 'sliding window' is a 'sliding variable-size window.' I think the classic problem here is looking for palindromic substrings. 

``` python
text = 'racecar'

for i in range(len(text)): #'i' is the starting index
    for j in range(i + 1, len(text) + 1): #'j' is the end index
        substring = text[i:j]
        if substring == substring[::-1] and len(substring) > 1:
            palindromes.append(substring)
```

In this solution we loop through each index position of the text (0, 1, 2...)—these are the start indices. `j` is our end index so we want our `range` object to start with 1 (the `i + 1`) and end with `7` (`len(text) + 1`) so that when we slice later the `7` will allow us to access the last character of the text (since the end number used in a slice is non-inclusive we need 1 greater than the length of our text).

## Iterating Through Multiple Iterables at Once Using `zip()`
Sometimes we need to loop between two sets of iterables at the same time. For example, let's say we had a list of names and ages separate lists and we want to print them together. As long as the two lists are the same size, `zip()` combines the similarly indexed elements into a tuple and works similar to `enumerate()` as described above.

``` python
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
ages = [25, 30, 35]

for name, age in zip(names, ages):
    print(f"{name} is {age} years old")
```

## Using Python's `for`...`else` Loops
Something I learned putting this guide together is that Python supports a `for`...`else` loop construction. The `else` block executes only if the main `for` loop completes normally without hitting a `break` statement.

```python
names = ['Luke', 'Leia', 'Vader', 'C-3PO']
target = 'Han'

for name in names:
    if name == target:
        print(f"Found {target} They're on the list!")
        break

else:
    print(f'{target} is not on the list!')
```

I think the use case for this type of loop is very specific, but good to know!

## Common `for` Loop Pitfalls
Here are some of the most common pitfalls when it comes to deploying `for` loops.

### Off-by-One Errors with `range()`
As illustrated above, `range()` is a very powerful and flexible component of many `for` loops. It can also be very confusing to figure out especially when the `stop` value in range is abstracted (i.e. is given by passing in the result of a `len()` function call). 

At the most basic level, the key is to remember that because the `stop` value of `range()` is exclusive, and indexing starts at `0`, then the `stop` value provided to `range()` needs to be one greater than the length of your iterable. 

Say you want to print numbers 1 through 10. Your brain might instinctively think to use `range(10)`, when actually what you need is `range(11)`.

``` python
# Stops at 9
for i in range(1, 10):
    print(i)
# Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

# Stops at 10
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)
# Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
```

This gets especially tricky with the sliding window techniques, wherein we actually need to reduce the `stop` value provided to `range()` to compensate for the window we create in the iteration.

You can see in the below example what happens if we forget to reduce the range. We actually don't get an error, since slicing is forgiving, but we do get values that we don't necessarily want. In this case, even though we want a sum of multiple numbers, the slicing just keeps going. This would be a confusing result since there is no explicit error.

``` python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Want to sum every 3 consecutive numbers
for i in range(len(numbers)):  # len(numbers) -> 5
    print(sum(numbers[i:i+3]))

# 6 = (1 + 2 + 3)
# 9 = (2 + 3 + 4)
# 12 = (3 + 4 + 5)
# 9 = (4 + 5)
# 5 = 5
```
Putting this example together made me realize how forgiving slicing is. Take a look at the following example and see if you can guess what it will print.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

print(numbers[4])
print(numbers[10:20])
print(numbers[10])
```
Had you asked me this before writing this guide, I would have thought the second and third print lines would both throw an `IndexError`. But actually here is the result.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

print(numbers[4]) #5
print(numbers[10:20]) #[]
print(numbers[10]) #IndexError
```

Anyway, the solution to this problem is to reduce the `stop` value provided to `range()` so that the looping stops once we've retrieved all the sums that we care about.

``` python
# CORRECT:
for i in range(len(numbers) - 2):  # Stop 2 positions early
    print(sum(numbers[i:i+3]))

# 6 = (1 + 2 + 3)
# 9 = (2 + 3 + 4)
# 12 = (3 + 4 + 5)
```

## Conclusion 
`for` loops—especially when combined with the flexibility of `range()` and the power of indexing and slicing—are one of the most common tools used in Python. It is therefore incumbent upon us to understand them deeply. I hope that the above guide is a good start to accomplishing that objective.
